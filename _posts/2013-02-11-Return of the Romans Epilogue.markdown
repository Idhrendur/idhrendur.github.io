That went terribly. On the forums, I had been ahead on my playing and writing, and was doling out posts (ah, the days when I had a buffer of posts). So I was able to promptly start a new series. The same shall happen here.

Again, during the CK2 era, I will be roleplaying the rulers. The overarching goal is to restore the Empire (including pushing it to its largest historical borders), but specific progress will be bound by the ruler's personality. Mending the great schism will also depend on the personalities of any emperors with opportunity to do so. There will be favoritism towards greek rulers. That one's mostly some long-term meta-gaming, though it seems reasonable enough to me that an emperor would deal better with subordinates who shared a primary language.

Recommendations on my play style or my writing style are welcome.
