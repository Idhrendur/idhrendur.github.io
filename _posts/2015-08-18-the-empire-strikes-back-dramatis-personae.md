<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Michael Doukas (zenpheonix)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Michael Konstantios Doukas
Birth year: 1855
Home/Residence: Athens (official), Thessaloniki (personal)
Party Affiliation: Foederatoi (official), leaning towards socialism (though this is not expressed in public)
Bio ((a bit long)): Michael belongs to a new generation of Doukoi. Along with his cousins, he believes that it is the people that make the Empire great, and as Imperial citizens they must be afforded appropriate rights and respect. After all, what are the Imperial Legions without the common soldier? What is Imperial industry without the workers toiling to make the machines work? What is the Imperial economy without the merchants that prop it up and further the Empire's economic interests around the world?
He inherited from his grandfather and his father the sympathy for the working class, yet publicly refuses to identify as a true socialist to not be lumped into the same category as the radical socialists and communists. Like his father, he served in the Athenian Lancers upon graduation from the Imperial War Academy in Constantinople. Luckily he had gone into politics, assuming temporary powers over Thema Graecia and the Governorship of Syria while his father was on the Senate, when the Lancers were sent on that ill-fated mission into Transylvania and were utterly destroyed by an unknown enemy.
Despite his military training, he had a talent for administration, managing to secure the trust and respect of the Athenians and other citizens he governed through his tolerant policies. He now wishes to bring his talents to the Senate to improve the Empire's well-being.
However, there is one obstacle to all of this: his brother's dark legacy. Though he wishes to put Konstantinos's Rebellion behind him, it would not be easy.</p>
<i>Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ (XKM)</i> Members
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heraclius Komnenos (Username1453)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Heraclius Komnenos
Birthdate: September 20th, 1841, in Constantinople
Party Affiliation: Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ (XKM)- Liberal Party
Biography: Born of the son of an influential noble in his townhouse in Constantinople. The Komnenos family traces it's lineage back over an 800 years in it's genealogical records and it's well known that the family traveled with Constantine when he founded Constantinople. Heraclius grew up much like many young nobles. He lived in the city with occasional trips to the countryside and ancestral lands. He was a restless young man, however, constantly traversing the city and engaging with it's lower classes. He consorted with merchants, blacksmiths, cooks, and others. His experience constantly left him impressed by the intellect that the people showed and the diligence they showed in a cruel life. He entered Constantinople's University and studied the humanities (One of the few Greeks in the department!) and philosophy. He was impressed by the political and ideological thoughts produced there and became adamant in his support for more liberal political policies. However, he maintained that the Roman Empire held a special place in human affairs. That the government should be reformed with universal suffrage for all people and a political body that reflected the population. However, he believed that the head of state and head of government should be the Doukas Imperial Family. They have restored the empire and have shown judgment and foresight, as well as the benefits of the stability, decisiveness, and swiftness of action that this gives to the government. After his graduation from University, Heraclius joined the military and remained in service progressing through the ranks till a year ago. In the last year, Heraclius has been influential in forming and directing political movements that are demanding a degree of democracy. When his father died, he left to him a position in the Senate which was greatly disputed amongst his siblings. (They didn't want to be connected to a person they thought of as a radical.) He joined the Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ (XKM) because of their similarities on core values, however, he supports a more interventionist foreign policy than is normal party line.
Basically, a Prussian Constitutionalist who advocates Free Trade, Interventionism, Pluralism, Full Citizenship, Anti-Military. On social reforms, he supports some safety regulations and high education. He may, if he feels the people strongly support it, support a low minimum wage or work hours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Magnus Kvensson (Beaverman1)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Magnus Kvensson
Home: Barcelona, Espana
Date of Birth: 22.5.1849
Political Party: XKM (for now)
Description: Magnus is currently not comfortable in any of the main parties of the senate, but supports the internal policies of the XKM</p>
<i>Koinonikistai</i> Members
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nicodemo Theodosio (NiccoTesla)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Nicodemo Theodosio
Birthdate: May 3rd, 1839, in Tarragona
Party Affiliation: I Koinotita
Biography: Born the son of a successful businessman in the Catalonian region of Terraconensis, Nicodemo became a successful writer and political theorist in the Spanish-speaking regions of Roman Spain. His theories of the Rise of Imperialism and the State's role in a society began some of the first Socialist organizations in the Roman Empire. He has been threatened with censorship and imprisonment, but his popular support among the Spanish and advocacy for a continuation of the Roman State in a socialist vein has allayed some worries. He supports the theory of International Revolution and desires the Roman State to either reform towards economic democracy or be toppled by its dissatisfied inhabitants if it refuses. The Empress is a topic he has written multiple essays on, and praises her power as a symbol of International identity of the Roman Empire, and as not entirely the same as the aristocracy, which he does protest, though their powers have been severely limited. Many less developed nations have their own theories of communism in the Juche school, and an absolute hereditary leader is a part of that school of thought. Nicodemo has largely been given this seat as an experiment, and to see what on Earth these Socialists are going on about.</p>

<i>Unaffiliated Characters</i>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nestorius Septiadis (Damian0358)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Nestorius Septiadis
Birthday: 22nd of June, 1849
Party affiliation: Unaffiliated, leaning towards the Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ and Koinonikistai
Biography: Born in Hadrianopolis, thanks to his father, at a young age, he not only received the chance to travel around the territories of Rome, but also the chance to travel around the rest of Europe and the Middle East. He received greater opportunities to study many things, such as history, linguistics, geography, cartography and more, as he met many non-Greeks as well as Greeks, both within the Empire and outside of it. As such, he is way more sympathetic to non-Greeks than his father. Wanting to follow his father in his footsteps, he decided to join the Senate as an unaffiliated senator, though he leans more to the left. Speaking at least 7 different languages and able to read multiple writing styles, he hopes to help if a translator is needed. Just don't mention the unfortunate connection between his name and his date of birth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Columba Comminus (righ na-Alba)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Ave!
Your Imperial Majesty, Your Holiness, Honourable and Eminent Senators.
My apologies for arriving late for this particular session so if you will allow a few minutes for an introduction I promise to keep it brief. (Though I have provided a longer version explaining my origins further for those of you who so wish to read it)
The origins of my family are shrouded in mystery thought to date back to the time when Rome was ruled by Kings me and my kin are said to be descended from slaves who won their freedom in the overthrow of the last king and establishment of the Republic.
Overtime we rose to a respected, but not prominent or powerful place in society. By the time of the Caesars we were a rich equestrian (and on occasion senatorial) family who migrated to Roman controlled Caledonia for what most said was at long last an aim to rise to higher positions within the Empire. But despite what you may have heard was an attempt to move to more suitable climes as the paler complexion and hair of my dynasty led to an unfortunate tendency to be almost permanently sunburnt or very heavily tanned even in the winter. Those of you who have been "Up North" as they say just South of Hadrian's Wall will know the change suited us admirably (though sunshine is nice from time to time).
After our fellow countrymen withdrew; first from Caledonia then Britannia altogether you may have thought we would have found ourselves alone and surrounded by a hostile people.
Thankfully the natives were found to be much friendlier once we stopped lording it over them and got on rather well and soon found common ground in our love of the weather, alcohol and poking fun at those men sissy enough to wear trousers.
Over the intervening centuries my family endured a series of rises and falls from wealth and power to destitution and irrelevance. We may have been down at times but never out which is more than can be said for most families which lied in the border regions of Scotland (or indeed any region of anywhere).
Which brings us to the here and now. I myself was born some years ago in “the early days of Winter 1855” according to my Da nobody bothered to note the exact date as my mas’ 13 hours of labour had left her in a spectacularly foul mood and my Da’ hand nearly half chewed off (we are still to hear the end of it).
I lead quite an active youth studying and travelling both within and without the empire. I have studied not only various languages but also am fully qualified in matters of both Scots and Roman law (which are remarkably similar) as well as theology and history according to Glasgow, Constantine, the Gregorian and Paris Universities respectively (I must confess I am rather anti-social preferring a good night’s reading to a good night’s drinking any day) I also had the honour of enjoying a brief though largely ceremonial tenure as a junior officer in the Varangian Guard and as a navy cadet. (Celts and Anglo-Saxons have been part of the guard ever since the Vikings started raiding us. Though if you value your lives you will please ensure that the Angles are as far as possible from the Celts in the same room while sober and preferably city while not (which I regret to say the latter is the norm).
And so now after an absence of many centuries my family has asked me to come to the Queen of cities to reclaim the seat in the Senate that once belonged to us. Provided your majesty has no objections.
As for political leanings I have come primarily to represent the interests of my Family and those who live in the lands surrounding my birth so you will forgive me I hope if I do not align myself just yet.
Thioridh an-drasta and God love you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Αιδεν Γκρέυ (BBBD316)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">* Into the senate chamber walks a broken and haggard man, leaning heavily on a much younger man in the latest military style*
My sincere apologies for my long hiatus my Empress. A number of years ago I was a Senator like you corpulent pigs in wolves clothing, I saw with disgust the so called elite of the Empire lead our Empress further and further from the true path of the Empire and the Glorious Republic that it sprouted from. The Cult that these men shy from is nothing less than a cabal of nobles of masonic heritage attempting to stop the people from seeing their Empress and expressing the woes of the Empire.
After I laid my allegations against certain high ranking members of the Senate I was visited by a man, a man who promised a way that truth could return to this chamber of lies that even know sees more Freemason plots against our Empress! This man was supposed to take me back to my home lands to meet with landed gentry and merchants that wanted to support a drastic change in the Empire.
Instead I was bound, gagged and beaten and left in some South East Asian hell hole, there I had to work with the common man to survive for years, it was not till I was able to reach my son working at his post as Governor that I was able to be freed. So many years wasted whilst those here continue to bleed the vitality of the Empire.
In short Empress, I Senator Στήβεν Γκρέυ now I am too old to continue and my son Αιδεν will now take my place. I would heartily recommend him for Chief of Staff.</p>

<strong>Former Player Characters</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Potitus Caristanius Gallio (The Crows)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing Potitus Caristanius Gallio, born on November 7th 1796 in Rome. His father was a wealthy Greek trader who made millions off of a multitude of trade posts in hubs across the Empire. He is a short man, never rising above 5'6 with brown hair and brown eyes. He is also not really a looker either with a face most accurately described as squished with his crooked smile being his most defining feature. What he lacked in looks he more than made up for in political prowess and quickly joined the Senate using his fathers money and his own rather Machiavellian ways. He arrived a boy in a mans game but soon found solace with a group of like minded men who called themselves the <i>Patrikioi</i>. While he recognized the Senate was powerless in many aspects, having the dubious distinction of being under an absolute monarchy; but he aimed to change that and strengthen the Senate. It was not however in line with the XKM factions Liberal attitudes but rather one some call outdated. He wanted a restoration of the Senate of the Republic, one that held the ultimate authority over what the Nation did and an abolishment of the so called Emperor's of Rome.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Basileios Rellis (Attalus)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing Basileios Rellis, born on the 7th of November 1801 in Konstantinopolis. The heir of one of the oldest aristocratic families of the Empire, Basileios sees as his duty to serve in the Senate and advise the Emperor. Having never wandered much outside his great estate of Thrace and the parties organised by the best families of the Imperium he can't imagine another way of governing : the Emperor at the top, aristocrats beside him and the pleb far below. His recent lectures of Platon and Xenophon only confirmed himself in his belief of being a part of the "good". As such he decided to join the Patrikioi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Konstantinos Galatías (Sakura_F)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing <i>Konstantinos Galatías</i>, born September 1, 1796, belongs to middle class. He is a <i>Foideratoi</i>, and is committed to a strong Empire. He has four sons, Andronikos, Ioannes, Andreas and Theodoros.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ovulur Kishiev (CaterpillarKing)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I introduce Ovulur Kishiev, a direct descendant to several famous Roman generals and born into a wealthy family in Cayenne in Roman Colombia,March 8 1798. Soon after he turned 17, he began to see the world around him for what it really was. He saw the lack of political freedoms and was frankly appalled by it. For 4 years he worked hard to try and bring justice through many means, but failed at each of them. Through his trials though, he had become a master politician and rose up the ranks on the political ladder. Now he resides with the rest of the Senate, supporting the Foiderátoi party, fully supporting the liberalization of Rome, yet also supporting the expansion of its power through military strength.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nikephoros Doukas (zenphoenix)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing Nikephoros Doukas, born sometime in the 1790s in Athens to a well-to-do middle-class family with ties to the legions (actual birthdate is unknown due to a fire which destroyed most family records). He is a self-made man and has joined the Foideratoi Party to speak on behalf of the common people. He advocates for social reforms to increase the well-being of the people and has ideas for overhauling the Empire's education system so that we can have the best and brightest men and women serving Your Highness. He is currently neutral on matters regarding the military but slightly learns toward pro-military. He believes that some of the future Great Powers of the world will be in the Far East, and as such the Empire ought to form strong bonds of friendship with nations in Asia. As to the nature of citizenship, he believes that all people living within the Empire can attain citizenship and keep their beliefs and practices, provided they acknowledge the Empress as their sovereign ruler and serve the Empire well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Damianos Septiadis (Damian0358)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing Damianos Septiadis, born on the 5th of July, 1810 in Dyrrhachion, at a young age, he received the chance to travel around the territories of Mainland Rome, meeting many non-Greeks aswell as Greeks who speak their own regional dialects. As such, he is more sympathetic to non-Greeks. He would spend the next 18 years of his life traveling and studying across the entire Empire. Eventually, he decides that the only way to properly serve the Empire is to go into politics, joining the Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱. He is also known to dabble in mapmaking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Georgios Blenchard (GreatUberGeek)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing <i>Georgios Blenchard, </i>a member of the Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ party, born in 1798 in Paris, France. A Franco-Greek family led to his odd name; he is mainly concerned with the plight of non-Greeks, and wants to fight for their rights. This often puts him at loggerheads with his colleagues. Besides that, he is a normal social reform liberal, strongly against the military, for reform and decentralisation to some degree, and for interventionism.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Alexios Doukas (zenphoenix)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Name: Alexios Doukas
Birthday: sometime in 1821
Party affiliation: Foederatoi but leaning towards unaffiliated
Biography: Alexios is the eldest son of Imperial Senator Nikephoros Doukas. He joined the Imperial Army after finishing his studies and served from 1840 to 1865, when he took up politics after his father's death. Notable engagements include operations in the Levant against Iraq and Hedjaz, the Battle of Constantinople during the Cult's first and deadly attack on the Senate, numerous skirmishes with the Russians, and finally the rescue of his father from a Cult stronghold in the wilds of Africa. He shares many of his father's core values and is determined to destroy the Cult for good. He is married and has a son named Konstantinos who is in the Imperial Army as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mikael Moustakas (Andre Massena)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Introducing <i>Mikael Moustakas</i>, born on April 5, 1818 in Western Thrace. The founder of the house was a Norse commoner named Gunnar who served in the Varangian Guard and rose to become a captain in the year 1650. For his service, he was given a plot of land in Western Thrace and his descendants adopted the name <i>Moustakas. </i>House Moustakas has risen to become one of the most prominent houses in the Empire, though there origins prevent them from achieving a place in the imperial inner circle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Mikael has followed the family legacy and served as an officer in the Imperial Legions. He is a veteran of both Russian wars but was severely wounded and crippled in the last war. Mikael is a moderate "conservative" and aligns with the <i>Kyriarchía</i> faction. He believes that Greeks are the proper heirs of Augustus and Alexander but, keeping his family's origins in mind, believes that all ethnicities can consider themselves roman citizens and receive the benefits of imperial rule. Mikael thinks that the only legitimate states are the Empire and the ancient states of the Orient. Because of this, he believes that the whole world, excluding India, China, and Japan, should be brought under Roman rule. He also holds a strong hatred of Russian barbarians.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Στήβεν Γκρέυ (BBBD316)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">My I present Στήβεν Γκρέυ, born in 1817 in Ireland and fled Scottish master to Brittany, joining the local chapter of Christianikoú Kómmatos Metarrýthmisi̱ Seeking to open the Empire to the many facets of its loyal citizens, not just the Greeks.</p>
