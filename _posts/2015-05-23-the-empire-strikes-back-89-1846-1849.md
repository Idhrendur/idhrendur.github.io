<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summoning the Senate</strong></p>
Senators, your presence is requested for a State of the Empire Address on the First of January, 1849.

The following newspapers are considered significant by the archivists.

> All hail the Empire and the Empress who have brought us such glory against the Russian barbarians! The Imperial Army has more than proven its worth. I am also glad to see Ukraine on the Imperial map once more, and this time we will ensure they stay there.
> 
> \- Michelangelo Favero

> All hail the Empire and you, our glorious Empress ! Your name shall be remembered by the Ukrainian people for the centuries to come ! We must always reenforce the border with our armies for I fear the bear will come back after licking his wounds and who knows what his fury could do ?
> I expect that your husband surely rejoiced at the outcome of the war !
> 
> Empress, the map reveals us something : everywhere in the world, there is a center of Roman civilization spreading our way of life and ensuring bases for potential campaigns. Everywhere except one area that appears to be weak and ripe to take : East Asia. I think it is in the interest of the Empire to secure a port on China proper. The news of their weakness are public and I think we could take treaty ports where we could force them to trade on the terms we dictate ! However we have to refrain from taking too much land from them : the hordes of Asiatic will not be handled too easily.
> 
> Other than this case, I think the Empire is fine as it is and shall continue as such. Don't listen to the whispers of sedition : the only way to act with these so-called "liberals" is to force them to bow before you !
> 
> \- Basileios Rellis

> I congradulate you to the greatest extent on the recent war with Russia. We have finally put those damned <em>Ró̱soi</em>* back in their place. I hope this also sends a message to the world. Rome will not be tame for much longer. Now we must strike North and defeat the last vestiges to Pax Europa, the <em>Germanoí</em>**.

> I must say that those are great news for our Empire, the balance of power and peace have been again restored, however I have to say that agressive expansion of Russia was very dangerous for not only their weaker neighbors but also our Great Empire. We must make sure that our response time in future will be faster to prevent such dangers. With this in mind, I strongly support proposition made by Basileios Rellis.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The State of the Empire</strong></p>

We were determined to go to war with Russia. It may have been most sensible to wait, but Russia was also at war with Germany and Scandinavia. Russia had declared war on Scandinavia for the Kola peninsula, and Germany had come to Scandinavia's aid. Somehow, Germany and Russia's armies had marched past each other. Germany had occupied much of Ukraine, while Russia and Persia had in turn occupied much of Germany.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-9.png"></p>
In the east, XXIV. Legio began to occupy any Ukrainian territory. II. Legio sought to cut off Russian access to the sea: first the Black Sea, then the Caspian Sea. IV. Legio boldly marched straight for Moscow.

In the West, X. Legio sought to free German lands occupied by Russia and to defeat any Russian forces they could find in Germany. VI. Legio marched from La Rochelle to support them. Not shown on the map, XXIII. Legio moved form Dalmatia to free the eastern German lands.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-10.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-11.png"></p>

Persia defended Russia, so I. Legio marched for Tabriz.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-12.png"></p>

During the war, the new business regulations were finalized and passed into law. So We again looked to the University of Constantinople, seeking to learn how We might better govern the Empire.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-13.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-14.png"></p>

Of course, previous research continued to pay off.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-15.png"></p>

On the 6 of October, Russia signed a white peace with Germany. While this prevented Russian expansion, it also meant that Russia could focus on the Empire.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-16.png"></p>

X. Legio began a long march for Lieutva, while VI. Legio marched for Rovne. XXIII. Legio hunted down a Russian army in eastern Germany. IV. Legio had occupied the Moscow area and was marching for Ingria to block Russian access to the Baltic. Meanwhile XXIV. Legio, II. Legio, and I. Legio continued their tasks.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-17.png"></p>

In December, We were informed that Poland's former truce with Russia had expired. They accepted the resulting call to arms, eager for revenge.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-18.png"></p>

An advantage of denying Russia access to the Baltic was that their main fleet was forced into the Gulf of Finland, where the West Fleet waited for them. Their fleet was completely destroyed.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-19.png"></p>

That same strategy was then applied to Persia's fleet.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-20.png"></p>

Once the surrounding lands were occupied and We were certain we were not leading an ally to certain doom, We had Livonia join the war as well.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-21.png"></p>

In November of 1847, Russia sent a peace offer freeing the Ukraine. But We were not satisfied with this. Instead, we planned to foil their plans in Scandinavia before forcing a peace. We were not able to do so to Our complete satisfaction, but on December 2, a peace was made that included only Russia's claims, and not Persia's demands to form an independent Norway.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-22.png"></p>

And so We agreed to peace with Russia.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-23.png"></p>

While the legions were marching home (to be met with fresh cohorts to replace any losses), advancements in the nature of the State and Government were figured out.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-25.png"></p>

The war had demonstrated how a well-equipped army could easily circumvent the fortresses such as we had, so We had the Army Corps of Engineers research mobility on the strategic level, both how to use it to our advantage, and how to prevent our enemy's movement.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-26.png"></p>

While we were rebuilding and recovering, Bavaria fought against Hungary to reclaim Germanic lands. Despite Scotland's assistance, Bavaria won, and Hungary no longer held lands that were primarily German.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-27.png"></p>

Likewise, Japan had been fighting Iraq for control of Outer Manchuria for quite some time, and in December of 1848 Iraq ceded the territory.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-28.png"></p>

Simultaneously, the research into Strategic Mobility was completed.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-29.png"></p>

We began upgrading the border forts throughout the Empire, and tasked engineers throughout the Empire to develop railroads that could reliably provide long-distance transport.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-30.png"></p>

By the end of the year, We had eighteen fully equipped legions, as well as the Scholai Palatinae.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-31.png"></p>

During the war, the more extreme elements within the Empire finally stopped supporting the idea of rebellion as a political tool, and so the Empire was much calmer. Which left the question, what to do now?
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-32.png"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Responses to the Messages</strong></p>

Thank you for your kind words on our victories, Senators Favero, Rellis, Galilo, Damaskinos, .

Senator Rellis, your proposal actually hints at something We wished to propose. We have had our eye on Southeast Asia for some time. There are lands held by Persia, Hedjaz, and Iraq that could be taken for the Empire. But your proposal to seize some ports in Ming lands also is worth considering. What does the Senate think of this? Here are some maps showing the three countries respective territories:
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-33.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-34.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-35.png"></p>

Senator Galilo, We are afraid that while Germany would be easily defeated, they would be more than we could take in surrender, and more than we could administrate.

Senator Doukas, attacking the Castillians and Chagatai is a unique proposal. We are not sure what the aims might be though. Castille is a minor island nation with a small African colony, and Chagatai is isolated in central Asia. Would you expound on what the Empire would gain from such an adventure? Here are maps showing Castille's territory, and Chagatai's territory alongside that of its allies.
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-36.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/tesb_images/89-37.png"></p>

Senators, what would you consider to be worthy goals of the Empire?

<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Senators Speak</strong></p>

> Would not our recent conflict with Persia in the Russian war involve a truce with that nation? It would be unwise to attack them again so soon so as to not invoke the ire of the international community. Both Hedjaz and Iraq possess desirable land in the Indies. The territory in the Philippines and Taiwan could be beneficial to the Empire in particular. Either seems a fine target, which I will leave at your discretion, Empress.
> 
> \- Michelangelo Favero

> My heartiest congratulations to you, noble Basilissa, on the great victory over the Rus and the establishment of a Slavic border state between our two powers. Domination of the spice trade would seem like an excellent next step and would perhaps check the growing power of the East Asian blocs.
> 
> ~ Kyriakos Angelos

> While our most recent conflict was a major success I recommend that we re-organize the legions before we engage in another conflict. Perhaps it is time to return to the old system of 10. For the moment we can use 4 infantry, 4 cavalry, 1 engineer, and one dragoon. This method of combined arms ensures that the legions are always prepared. As always I am your humble servant Basiliia and seek to help where I can.  
> \- Constantine Panaretos

> I do think we should expand Roman power into the Far East. Russian lands in New Guinea are a tempting target, but I also do support taking some Ming ports.
> 
> \- Pontitus Caristanius Galilo

> As I said before, I'm strongly supporting idea of expanding our Empire in the Far East. I recommend claiming Taiwan as it is the closest territory to asian mainland (especially China) without going to war with so called Celestial "Empire". Also, if that is not to much to ask, I would like to see some of Empire's cartographers maps regarding core territories of Poland, Ukraine and Livonian Order to ensure that there should not be any conflict or crisis within our Sphere?
> 
> \- Alexios Damaskinos

> First off, apologies for ranting about the Castilians and Chagatai. I haven't seen maps of the Empire in a while.
> While I also support expansion into Eastern Asia, I must say that we should be careful with our actions taken there. Taking Ming ports would not be a good idea. Although we would gain footholds in the East and potentially gain new resources, we would have to spend many more resources managing the new colonies. The Chinese do not take kindly to being under foreign rule, and it would take ages to educate all of them in Roman ways and effectively assimilate them into the Empire. If Your Highness still wishes to invade China, though, I recommend going after the gold mines of Caozhou.
> That being said, we should seize the Russian possessions in the Pacific, especially Taiwan and the Philippines. They would weaken our enemy and also serve the same purpose as footholds in China, only easier to manage and without Chinese cores to provoke the Celestial Empire.
> Perhaps we could seek out a trading agreement or an alliance with the Celestial Empire? The original Empire under the Caesars established friendly trading relations with the Han Empire thousands of years ago. They would be a useful ally against the Russians, and if we help them to "westernize," a Sino-Roman alliance will be unstoppable. That is just my opinion though, Basilissa. The choice is yours.  
> \- Nikephoros Doukas

> Glory to the Empire!
> 
> I agree with my fellow senators great Empress, those lands in the Phillippines would seem to be a great addition to the Empire. In fact I am sure my son Γιώργος would be an able adiminstrator of any lands that were to come into our possession from such a venture.  
> \- Στήβεν Γκρέυ

> My Empress, whilst the victory over Russia and the restoration of the Borderlands is worth celebrating, we must remember that the region of Lithuania is still under the control of the Russians. We must find a way to diplomatically return these lands to the Borderlands as soon as we can. I agree with my fellow senators in regards of expanding into Southeast Asia.  
> 
> I would also like to re-suggest the idea of uniting the Germans. If we assist Germany in bringing Bavaria under its fold, I have no doubt that they would want to remain our allies. Denmark, on the other hand, should regain the territory of Jutland, thus allowing its German territories to be taken by Germany.  
> \- Damianos Septiadis

> Excellent idea, uniting the Germans. Isn't their empire called Germany for a reason?  
> Anything that weakens the Russians will benefit us at this point  
> \- Nikephoros Doukas

> I'm afraid senator Nikephoros Doukas, that I can't agree with you. I would say that uniting the Germans will weaken us more than the Russians. After making alliance with Poland and Livonia, and making Ukraine independent, I think that Germany has no reason to go to war with Russia. Further more, if we let Germans unite, Germany would go after us, taking into account that they consider some of our lands their cores. I will say more, this could even strengthen Russia because of possible Anti-Roman coalition led by Germany and Russia.

Clerks rush in, providing the maps that Senator Damaskinos had requested.

> As we can see on the map, both Livonia and Poland consider Lithuania as their core provinces. It would be better to let Russia keep it in future, if we let one of them take it, then we might face war between countries in our Sphere. Poland and Livonia are too weak to declare their own war for Lithuania against Russia, so it is up to us, to not make mistake in future by forgetting this issue.

> 
> \-Basileios Rellis

> Independent Lithuania would mean that Poland or Livonia will invade it, so it is useless. But one thing must be said: We needed Poland to defend Europe from Russian barbarians, now we should concentrate on Ukraine-Russia border, in fact, Poland is of no use to us anymore and it can cause trouble in future (disputed territory with Livonia).
> 
> \- Alexios Damaskinos

> I hope that Roman might would prove sufficient to repel barbarians Senator Damaskinos, should they decide to go against our will  
> \-Basileios Rellis

> If we were to go to war with Russia some time in the future to take their Baltic territory, I would favour handing it over to Livonia over Poland. They consider the entire region theirs, while Poland does not. It would also put them on more equal footing. I also agree with Senator Damaskinos on that Poland's importance as a buffer against Russia is no longer an issue, so it would serve better to aid Livonia first. However, Poland is not completely useless to us. Their mere existence keeps the German states from growing too strong. If anything, we can use them to weaken states like Bavaria, who even holds land Poland claims.

Senator Favero, you are correct that there is a truce with Persia. We would not be able to move against them immediately.

Senators Angelos, Galilo, Doukas, and Γκρέυ, We thank you for the encouragement for expansion in the far East. Senator Γκρέυ, We shall strongly consider your son as a governor of any new territories.

Senator Panaretos, We fear that splitting the current legions into more legions would not be helpful. A single of these smaller legions would be unable to stand against enemy armies by itself, so two would have to fight together at any given time, which is no different than matters as they are. However, We realize the We did not specify the composition of the Legions before. They currently consist of eight infantry cohorts, four artillery cohorts, two engineer cohorts, and two hussar cohorts. If We can improve the Empire's capability to support troops in one location, We will increase the Legions to eight cohorts of artillery. And the legions are using Hussars instead of Dragoons for their superior maneuverability and reconnaissance. But nevertheless, We thank you for your interest in the legions.

Senator Damaskinos, the suggestion to take Taiwan is an interesting one. We shall take it under consideration.

Senator Doukas, the idea of a trade treaty with Ming is curious. We shall see if such a matter is possible with the famously insular Ming.

Senator Septiadis, thank you for the reminder that there is still work to be done against Russia. Sadly, though, Germany has grown bombastic about the Burgundian peoples, insisting that they should be united into a Greater Germany, and thus refuses alliance with us. Pan-nationalist rebels in the north have greatly expanded them at the cost of minor nations and Denmark. Who knows, maybe they will eventually be able to stand against Bavaria on their own? Certainly they are no threat to the Empire, though.

In regards to Poland and Livonia, We will keep all of your suggestions in mind. But it seems unlikely that that land will be free from Russian control without intervention from the Empire.
